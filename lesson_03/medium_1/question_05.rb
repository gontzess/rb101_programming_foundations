# Alyssa asked Ben to write up a basic implementation of a Fibonacci calculator. A user passes in two numbers, and the calculator will keep computing the sequence until some limit is reached.

# Ben coded up this implementation but complained that as soon as he ran it, he got an error. Something about the limit variable. What's wrong with the code?

# How would you fix this so that it works?

## Either have to add limit as an arguement to the definition, or as a constant variable.

LIMIT = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while first_num + second_num < LIMIT
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"
