# 1) a method that returns the sum of two integers

=begin
Given two integers.

Add the integers together.

Return the sum.
=end

=begin
START
# Given two integers.

SET integer1
SET integer2
SET sum equal to integer1 + integer2
RETURN sum

# 2) a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

=begin
Given an array of strings.

Take each element and concatenate into a new string

Return new string
=end

=begin
START
Given Array of strings.

SET new_string

For each element in Array:
  concatenate element onto new_string

RETURN new_string
=end

# 3) a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

=begin
Given an array of integers.


=end
